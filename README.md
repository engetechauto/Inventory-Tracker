# Data Analysis and Visualization using Python

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing datasets using Python libraries such as `pandas` and `matplotlib`. The objective is to extract insights, perform statistical analysis, and create visualizations to summarize findings effectively.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (for data processing and analysis)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for an interactive coding environment)
- **pandas** (for data manipulation and preprocessing)
- **matplotlib & seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **NumPy** (for numerical computations)

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
   - Importing datasets from CSV, Excel, or online sources
   - Handling missing values and duplicates
   - Data type conversion and feature engineering

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Statistical summaries and data distributions
   - Correlation analysis
   - Identifying patterns and trends

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Line charts, bar graphs, histograms, and scatter plots
   - Heatmaps for correlation analysis
   - Interactive dashboards (optional)

4. **Insights & Conclusion**
   - Identifying key takeaways from the data
   - Making data-driven recommendations

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-analysis-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd data-analysis-project
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. Run the notebook to explore data and visualizations.
